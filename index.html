<b>What we think</b> : Movies have become very popular in the last century. It is the favorite pastime of many people across the world. The best thing about movies is that there are different genres. This means that everyone can find something interesting. Even though many movies are produced every year, there are some that are more popular than others. Movies have a part in influencing the masses and so are a great way of spreading information about things that affect the world. Students can be asked to write essays on movies from any genre. Cinema is in today&#8217;s world the most popular means of entertainment. Millions of people watch cinema everyday all over the world not only as a means of entertainment, but also as an escape from the monotony, boredom, anxiety and troubles of life. It is a restful, pleasurable and entertaining way of rewinding and relaxing after a long day&#8217;s work. All the senses are captivated while viewing cinema and the next two and a half or three hours are spent in a wink. Indian cinema has a charm, flavour and magic of its own.<br/><br/>  
  
  	It appeals not only to the film-crazy Indian public but also enchants a large number of audiences the world over. People who do not speak or understand Hindi still sing songs from Hindi films. An average Indian film is longer than films from other parts of the world, has a ginger-touch of love, hate, revenge, drama, tears, joys and also its own share of songs and dances. A typical Indian film has it all&#8212;all the spice and variety of life condensed into it, transporting the audience on a magic carpet to a totally different world where everything and anything is possible.<br/><br/>  
  
  	Infact, Salman Rushdie has quoted: &#8220;I have been a film buff all my life and believe that the finest cinema
is fully the equal of the best novels.&#8221; Down the years, cinema in India has reached its own destination, created its own history, touched its own milestones. From stereotyped love stories to action, to drama, to realistic, to fictional&#8212;the silver screen in its every aspect has mesmerised, captured and tantalised millions of every age, class and community. The journey from silent films to talking pictures, from black and white to coloured has been long. It has catered to the dreams and aspirations of many who have hungered for glamour and reached &#8216;Mumbai&#8217; and it still does.<br/><br/> 

	There have been two streams of cinema in India&#8212;one is the Commercial Cinema which has the sole aim of entertaining and making money in return. The second stream is the Parallel Cinema or the Art Cinema which aims at sensitising people on various social issues and problems of the society. While Commercial Cinema appeals to all sections of the society, Parallel Cinema appeals mainly to the intellectual class and the intelligentsia of the society. But a change has taken place over the last decade and a half. A general awareness among people has increased and Art Cinema is being more and more appreciated by a large number of people. Many a times, an art film does much better at the box-office than a mainstream commercial film. This has resulted in the thinning of the differentiating line between Art and Commercial Cinema.<br/><br/>  
              
	Cinema has an educative value too. Because it exercises a deep influence upon the minds of the people; cinema can be used as a very effective reformative instrument. Statutory warnings are included to spread the awareness about the adversity of smoking has compelled many to quit the habit. Social awareness can be generated on issues like dowry, women education, abortion, girl foeticide, youth unrest, corruption, unemployment, poverty, illiteracy etc. Films like No One Killed Jessica, My Name Is Khan, The Attacks of 26/11 are some movies which have dealt with current sensitive issues.<br/><br/>  
   
  	Cinema can expose the evils prevalent in society. It is the most effective means of mass communication. Cinema also is a great unifying force in a diversified country like ours. People belonging to all communities and sections, speaking any language, watch the cinema with the same fascination and excitement. Moreover, people can go to places with cinema. We travel from Ooty to Shimla to Switzerland to Washington to Sydney. It also encourages the art of music, singing, dancing, script-writing, direction etc. It employs a large number of people from technicians to producers to spot boys to dress makers. Thousands of people earn their livelihood through cinema. <br/><br/>Movies are a favorite pastime throughout America. There are many different types of movies, and people prefer different ones. Whether it is drama, comedy, or suspense, it seems like they are all equally preferred. The three best movies of the year were the comedy, Meet The Parents, the drama, Ghost, and the suspenseful, Final Destination.<br/><br/>
             Meet The Parents was a big hit ever since it was shown in theaters. Ben Stiller, who played the role Greg Focker, starred in this hilarious film. It was about his disastrous visit to meet the Byrnes. Greg had gone through unbelievable troubles before getting them to accept the relationship. For instance, Greg did not get along well with his fianc茅e's father, Jack Byrnes.<br/><br/>
             Greg mentioned how he abhorred cats while the Byrnes owned one. Even Focker's name was made fun of. The more Greg tried to impress the family, the more they disliked him. Everything Greg did went wrong, and everything that was said were thought to be lies. For example, when Jack tested the lie detector on Greg, all the answers turned out negative. Greg also accidentally destroyed his fianc茅e's sister's wedding. After that, the Byrnes were not able to tolerate him any longer, so Greg left. When they found out that Focker did not lie nor destroyed the wedding on purpose, Jack went looking for him, and finally agreed to let him be a part of the family. 
  <br/><br/>This movie got the crowd crying in laughter until the very end.
             <br/><br/>Like Meet The Parents, Ghost made its viewers cry, but for a different reason. Ghost was about a murdered man who was unable to move on. Sam Wheat remained on earth as a ghost.<br/><br/>
              The experience of watching a movie from a local move theater and your house are very different. The differences include: comfort, privacy, price, and overall experience, because you will have different opinions on which you would prefer when you include all of these factors. Going to a movie with your friends and family could be a nice night spent out of the house, but to others staying home watching a movie with their loved ones could be a greater experience. Watching movies is always something fun and memorable, whether it be from the comfort of your own home, or from the view of a big screen. The difference in price between the two choices are significantly different. 
  <br/><br/>Going to the movie theater can be the most expensive date night. There are many factors that come with the experience of watching a move from a movie theater and the main one would be the price. When going to a movie theater you must use gas to drive to the movie, while if you were to stay in and watch a movie you would not have to use any gas. Watching a movie at the theater cost you roughly eight to ten dollars a person depending on many things. If you are watching a movie and there are two people with you that is twenty dollars you have spent to watch a movie. If you were to go to the store and buy a movie you would spend around twenty dollars to buy the movie.<br/><br/>inspired anyone who watched him. Every time you watch a Rocky movie, you feel like you can conquer the world. He used the same technique in some movies, such as, Rambo and Cobra. In Rambo, Stallone was a one-man wrecking crew that he also portrayed in Rocky. He would be sent on one-man missions to destroy the whole country. lot of people on the planet who search everday only one thing that is movie download sites. but all are not find right link. some of the blog only use movie download sites name for ranking on google. we are not use fake links. here we listed only right site url which are always working perfect. but today we are not on top of google because some of high authority entertainment sites are daily update their content. today movies are become very popular source of entertainment. and that is reason for leaked many movie today on the internet before the release date. here is some of example.
   <br/><br/>-> Janhvi Kapoor and Pankaj Tripathi starrer Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl  released on Netflix. However, the film has become the latest target of piracy and has been leaked online for free HD downloading on piracy sites Tamilrockers.
   <br/><br/>-> Much-hyped film Thappad starring Taapsee Pannu has hit the theatres today and the film has received good reviews from the audience and the critics. However, the film has now been leaked on the piracy site Tamilrockers and it has left the makers worried. The film is available for free HD downloading on the torrent sites. Thappad shows the courage of a woman who has dedicated her entire life for the well-being of her husband and the family but the man doesn&#8217;t think twice before hitting her &#8216;for the first time&#8217; at a house party. She seeks legal help to make sure that everyone understands how it&#8217;s not about &#8216;one slap&#8217;, it&#8217;s about &#8216;the slap&#8217; and the man who has no right to hit a woman &#8211; not once, not twice, never ever!
  <br/><br/> -> The War drama film Panipat starring Arjun Kapoor, Kriti Sanon, and Sanjay Dutt which released in theatres today has now become the latest victim of the piracy site Tamilrockers. The film is a historical drama set in the 18th century and revolves around one of the greatest wars of Indian history. The film was much hyped and audiences were eagerly waiting for the film to release. However, with the leakage of the film, it may suffer at the box office and earnings might be affected.<br/><br/>
  Panipat presents the fierce journey of Sadashiv Rao Bhau (Arjun Kapoor), the Commander-in-Chief of the Maratha Army who leads a northern expedition to fight off the invading forces of Ahmad Shah Abdali (Sanjay Dutt), the King of Afghanistan. On the other &#8216;Parvati Bai&#8217; (Kriti Sanon) the queen of the reign also fights along with the brave warrior &#8216;Sadashiv Rao Bhau&#8217; in the battle against the forces of Ahmad Shah Abdali.
  <br/><br/> -> Standing true to their notoriety, piracy website Tamilrockers have leaked Punit Malhotra directorial Student of The Year 2 starring Tara Sutaria, Tiger Shroff and Ananya Panday. The movie hit the theatres in India on Friday, May 10 and just a day after the torrent site leaked the movie online, resulting in a blow on its already low stakes.<br/><br/>
  The movie is going to end its first weekend at the Box Office. After opening at Rs 12.06 crore, SOTY 2 went on to garner Rs 14.02 crore on its second day at the ticket window. This is higher than the opening day but lower than what was expected from the film. Student Of The Year 2 is the debut film of two lead female faces in it &#8211; Ananya and Tara. A lot of buzz was created among the audience with the introduction of the two girls. However, that didn&#8217;t completely seem to have got translated into numbers at the Box Office.
  <br/><br/> -> Nawazuddin Siddiqui-starrer Babumoshai Bandookbaaz continues to make headlines for all the undesirable reasons. The film saw the light of the day and finally released on August 25, 2017, after braving through a string of controversies including preposterous stand by CBFC that ordered 48 cuts in the film. Kushan Nandy-directed film is in the news for getting leaked online days after its release. Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Bidita Bag&#8217;s Babumoshai Bandookbaaz full movie leaked online and made available for free downloads and watch online options. The Indian crime drama has been given A-certification mainly due to the raw portrayal of intimate sexual scenes between Nawaz and Bidita. With the piracy targeting Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, it has to be seen how badly it affects film&#8217;s box office collections.
   <br/><br/>-> David F. Sandberg directed Annabelle: Creation film hit theatres on August 18, 2017, and it has been spreading terror like no other in recent times. The American supernatural horror movie is receiving positive reviews and raking stupendous box office collections. The prequel of 2014&#8217;s Annabelle, Annabelle Creation also dubbed as Annabelle 2 is also a prime target of movie buffs that intend to catch the film outside cinema halls &#8211; at home, thanks to Annabelle Creation Full Movie leaked online, the prevalent practice of piracy. The search for Annabelle Creation full movie download and watch free online is high but what is surprising is it that the links of live streaming and illegal downloads are provided by LinkedIn. Yes, fishy links for Annabelle Creation movie download is available on LinkedIn, an employment oriented social-networking platform than torrent sites.<br/><br/>
  Annabelle: Creation is turning out to be 2017&#8217;s biggest box office wonder. Annabelle, the story of a demon-possessed doll which released in 2014 now has a perfectly made prequel in Annabelle: Creation. The new horror film gives an insight to the time when the evil spirit bewitched doll was created, and all hell broke loose. Helmed by Lights Out director David F. Sandberg, Annabelle Creation got great reviews from the critics while fans are robbed of their living daylights (a compliment for the makers of the horror genre). But just like the satanic force has taken over the doll, the successful film has become a target of online piracy &#8211; an evil hampering the business of cinema.
   <br/><br/>-> Baahubali 2: The Conclusion released to packed theatres on 28th April 2017 worldwide. The second film of the hit franchise, a sequel to Baahubali: The Beginning broke all existing opening day records by minting Rs 121 crore in India and grossed Rs 200 crore plus across the globe. The film released in multiple languages witnessed stupendous box collection, overshadowing all previous records including those held by Bollywood superstars. Aamir Khan&#8217;s Dangal, Salman Khan&#8217;s Sultan or Shah Rukh Khan&#8217;s Happy New Year&#8217;s collection were plummeted by Prabhas&#8217;s demi-god Bahubali avatar.<br/><br/>On the one hand, if Baahubali 2: The Conclusion humongous box office collection sandstorm is growing stronger with every passing day, the craze for the film has invited the piracy troubles. The film suffered several setbacks with the climax video of why Kattappa killed Bahubali was circulated on WhatsApp. In an attempt to kill the buzz by releasing the suspense behind the biggest mystery, the miscreants took the illegal step. In an another incident, SS Rajamouli&#8217;s ambitious project was leaked by a Kuwait-based user on Facebook, who posted the link to watch Bahubali 2 movie online as well as do free downloads.
  <br/><br/> -> Naam Shabana is a spin-off prequel to the Neeraj Pandey directed 2015 film Baby, which has Akshay Kumar in the lead. Naam Shabana directed by Shivam Nair has Taapsee Pannu reprise her role as Shabana, and it is her story in focus. Taapsee who cemented her position in Bollywood movies with her gritty role of Delhi girl, Minal Arora in critically and commercially successful, 2016 film Pink is expected to do shine in the tailor-made &#8216;women-centric&#8217; movie Naam Shabana. In the supporting cast, we have the talent of versatile actors Prithviraj Sukumaran, Manoj Bajpayee and Anupam Kher. Despite the film being about Taapsee&#8217;s Naam Shabana, it is Akshay Kumar&#8217;s cameo which is generating more buzz among the movie goers.<br/><br/>
  The film has not received out and out positive reviews with many critics pointing out at the loopholes, clearly seen in dated dialogues and dramatization. The effect of average movie reviews is reflected in Naam Shabana&#8217;s box office collections with the film earning Rs 11.49 crore at the end of opening weekend. The film earned Rs 5.12 crore and Rs 6.37 crore on Friday and Saturday respectively.
   <br/><br/>-> Vidyut Jamwal reprises the role of Captain Karanvir Singh Dogra in the sequel of high-octane second installment of the action franchise, Commando 2: The Black Money Trail. Like the title suggests, this multicast film is based on the black money issue and demonetization drive announced by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The film laced with some never-seen-before action and fight sequences has not garnered favourable reviews from the critics but hoped to attract cinema lovers fond of action movies. But at the end of opening weekend, it has managed lukewarm box office collections of Rs 13.25 crore in the domestic market.<br/><br/>
  Commando 2 also starring Shefali Shah, Satish Kaushik and Suhail Nayyar, projected the movie as an out-and-out action flick with Vidyut being the driving force. Actresses Adah Sharma and Esha Gupta are filling up the glam quotient of the movie, but so far the film has only taken a beating. The film which clashed with Hollywood release, Logan starring Hugh Jackman is finding it difficult to lure the audiences compared to devoted Australian actor&#8217;s fans who are flocking in numbers to catch their favourite star in the role of Wolverine for the final time.
   <br/><br/>-> Badrinath Ki Dulhania is Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt&#8217;s third film together, and the pair is looking forward to delivering yet another box office hit. BKD is the second installment of a franchise that began with 2014 film Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania also directed by Shashank Khaitan and produced by Dharma Productions. The love story between Badrinath Bansal (Varun) and Vaidehi Trivedi (Alia) met with dicey reviews who on the one hand appreciated the lead actor&#8217;s performances but seemed hesitant in giving a definite thumbs up to the plot and theme entirely. Nevertheless, the footfalls in the theatres proved that Varun and Alia have turned into the bankable stars who can pull their fans irrespective of not-so-favourable reviews.<br/><br/>Despite the film doing so well in both domestic and international box offices, Badrinath Ki Dulhania is facing a similar but uncalled for roadblock &#8211; Online Piracy. A day after the release of the movie, it was leaked online on the social media, and several websites provided a link for illegal downloads as well as watch online options. The print quality of the film is not of superior quality.

Joining him in the film is Bollywood&#8217;s A-listed actress, Deepika Padukone, making the film even grander on the scale. All the factors have led to the movie being a prime target of online piracy. Every year in India, Hindi film industry suffers from significant loss due to movies getting leaked online and made available for free download and watched online.<br/><br/>The 31-year-old Indian beauty plays the role of spy, Serena Unger in the third installment of hit xXx franchise.

  <br/><br/> -> Rangoon has been one of the highly-awaited films of recent times. The collaboration of talented actors Saif Ali, Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut with ace director Vishal Bharadwaj made it an exciting project for the cinema lovers. The Casablanca-like love triangle saw Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor come together for the first time on the silver screen. Yes, it is a big deal as Saif&#8217;s actress wife Kareena Kapoor Khan once was in a serious relationship with Shahid Kapoor. And, then we have an acting powerhouse, feisty Kangana Ranaut working for the first time with Vishal. The sizzling hot chemistry between Shahid and Kangana and the royal power of Saif fetched strong Box office predictions for Rangoon. Rangoon had everything to be one of 2017&#8217;s top grossing films but mixed to negative reviews, and now the film getting leaked for illegal download and online watch, the fate of Rangoon looks bleak.
   <br/><br/>-> The Ghazi Attack is the film is based on the mysterious sinking of PNS Ghazi during Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Directed by Sankalp Reddy, the film has a string of talented actors in the form of Rana Daggubati ,Taapsee Pannu , Kay Kay Menon, late actor Om Puri and Atul Kulkarni. The film distributed by Dharma Productions for larger audiences in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil market. Branded as India&#8217;s first underwater film, The Ghazi Attack quickly became the talking point since its trailer release on January 11, 2017.<br/><br/>
  The Ghazi Attack which released on Friday, February 10 is all over the internet already. There are numerous sites which are providing an average print version of the film. Despite the poor quality of the movie, it is downloaded and watched online multiple times. The Ghazi Attack which is based on a historical event involving patriotism has caught viewers&#8217; attraction. It is to be seen if the film can survive the online piracy considering it does not feature any A-listed star, a much-needed resource to avoid hurting box office collections.<br/><br/>
  ->Jolly LLB 2 is one of the most anticipated movies of the year 2017. There is so much hype around the film because it is a sequel to the highly acclaimed 2013 film Jolly LLB. Akshay Kumar replaces Arshad Warsi who had given an iconic performance as original Jolly. There is a certain amount of pressure on Akshay to be accepted in the role of a small-town, street-smart lawyer Jolly in the upcoming film. The pressure mounted especially after Arshad Warsi revealed how he was supposed to be part of the second installment of Jolly LLB, but then the makers wanted a &#8216;bigger star&#8217;, which is why Akshay Kumar was roped in.<br/><br/>
    Not just the burden of expectations but Jolly LLB 2 got embroiled in several controversies as well. Akshay Kumar&#8217;s upcoming film ran into trouble over the movie allegedly making fun of the lawyers and the legal profession. The film was originally passed by India&#8217;s Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) but the Bombay High Court intervened and demanded the makers to delete four scenes mocking the lawyers. Despite the setback, the lead actor has been gracious enough to accept High Court order. But the tiring times for Akshay Kumar and Jolly LLB 2 seem to not end with online piracy casting its dark shadows over it.<br/><br/>
   ->Early this morning, Raees director Rahul Dholakia also expressed his displeasure with the online leak where people are watching his movie on their mobile phones! Dholakia took to Twitter, saying, &#8220;Depressing and heartbreaking to see people watching on phones and online (pirated) when the film is made for big screen experience. And so, I would like to thank all those of you who went to the theatres and saw the movies, multiple times. #watchRaeesintheatres&#8221;.<br/><br/>
  Raees also stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Mahira Khan and Sunny Leone. Raees was Shah Rukh Khan&#8217;s ambitious project and we could see it through the grand arrangements for promotions. Shah Rukh Khan travelled from Mumbai to Delhi on a train along with Sunny Leone and the director. He also visited Pune&#8217;s Symbiosis Institute of Design and danced with students to the song Zaalima. SRK had shared picture of a humongous crowd that had thronged to catch a glimpse of the superstar in Pune. He later visited the Golden Temple with his youngest son AbRam and also travelled to Ahmedabad as a part of the promotions.<br/><br/>
   ->Hrithik Roshan and Yami Gautam revenge-drama Kaabil is directed by Sanjay Gupta. It released on the same date, January 25 as that of Shah Rukh Khan and Mahira Khan&#8217;s gangster action flick Raees. Raees proved to be lethal for Kaabil at the box office with the latter making slow progress in terms of the box office collections. Kaabil has collected Rs 52.41 crore in four days compared to Raees making Rs 75.44 crore India business and Rs 38.14 cr at the international box office.<br/><br/>
  Kaabil is a story revolving around a visually impaired couple, Rohan (Hrithik) and Supriya (Yami). What begins off as a cute love story is soon turned into a dark drama with critics and fans calling out movie for portraying crime in such gory manner. Yami&#8217;s character gets brutally raped by local goons with political affiliations, and it is followed up with misogynistic Bollywood masala film. Hrithik Roshan&#8217;s incredible acting is touted to be the saving grace in this predictable dark movie.<br/><br/>
   ->Bairavaa is the 60th movie of Tamil actor and singer, Ilayathalapathy Vijay. The hype around the release of the films featuring South Indian superstars who are treated no less than demi-gods by their fans is palpable. From catching up midnight shows to marking the celebrations by bursting crackers, Vijay&#8217;s Bairavaa is already a hit among the mass. Vijay is on a role with incredible response coming from fans for his film. Bairavaa released to packed houses after Vijay delivered a massive Box office blockbuster &#8216;Theri&#8217;. The actor-singer-dancer is matching up to the expectations, but the piracy and movie leaks threat are proving to daunt Vijay&#8217;s dreams of having back-to-back profitable films.<br/><br/>
  Vijay&#8217;s fears of facing online piracy wrath are not unreasonable as Bairavaa throughout the phase of post-production, and eventual release of posters, trailer and audio teaser were leaked online before the decided dates. The title of the film was revealed on the net much before the Bairavaa makers announced it officially.<br/><br/>
  ->Ever since the announcement was made about the filming and release of Dangal, cinema lovers patiently waited for its release date. After all, there were several reasons for the fans to look forward to Dangal, a sports biopic based on former Indian wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat. It starred none other than, Bollywood&#8217;s Mr Perfectionist, Aamir Khan in a never-seen-avatar plus the exciting movie plot, the journey of India&#8217;s first female wrestler to win a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games &#8211; Geeta Phogat (played by Fatima Sana Sheikh) and also her CWG 2014 gold medalist sister Babita Kumari (played by Sanya Malhotra).<br/><br/>
  Aamir Khan, an incredible actor and master strategist who understands the nuisances of the business of cinema delivered a blockbuster masterpiece at the box office. Dangal is living up to the hype and expectations of audiences which clearly reflects in the appreciations and massive box office collections. But the online piracy is proving to be a matter of great concern and acting as a roadblock for Dangal to surpass other box office records. Indian government which laid out stringent rules to crack down on torrents sites are proving to be ineffective in curbing online piracy which results in an enormous monetary loss in Bollywood every year.<br/><br/> Despite TRAI&#8217;s clear announcement of blocking such torrent sites, there are many which provided access to content illegally. Dangal, is one movie which is facing the wrath of illegal downloads on these sites. Few of torrents which are still active in India after Government&#8217;s announcement are 1337X, KickAss Torrents and ThePirateBay. To access them easily, they ask you to use VPN on these illegal URLs.<br/><br/>

  ->Sidharth Malhotra, Riteish Deshmukh and Tara Sutaria's 'Marjaavaan' has been the talk of the town since the announcement. The film team left no stones unturned to promote their flick on various platforms.<br/><br/>
And on Friday, the film has hit the theatres, however, unfortunately, it became the latest victim of piracy as it got leaked online on the same day.
According to reports making rounds on the internet, the infamous TamilRockers are responsible for leaking the film online. Several films like 'Dream Girl' 'Super 30', 'Bharat', 'Kabir Singh', 'Avengers Endgame' and 'MIB: International' were made available on the internet by the piracy site.
Reportedly, the web portal keeps changing the domain extension in order to keep running the site illegally. Ayushmann Khurrana and Nushrat Bharucha's latest film Dream Girl has become the latest victim of internet piracy. In just two days of its release, the film has been leaked on notorious piracy website Tamilrockers. <br/><br/>Trade analysts say the leaking of the film could hurt its overall business at the box office. Dream Girl is not the only film that's been leaked on Tamilrockers. The website is notorious for releasing Hollywood, Bollywood and South Indian films online.
<br/><br/>
Some of the biggest movies released by Tamilrockers were Avengers: Endgame, Zero, 2.0, Simmba, Aquaman and Maari 2. It recently leaked films like Bharat, Uri: The Surgical Strike and Manikarnika within a day or two of their release at the box office.

Tamilrockers is not legal and has been blocked over and over. Many moviemakers and service providers approached the courts to block the illegal site. However, when an illegal URL is taken down, another one sprouts to continue the work. Tamilrockers' business is a simple case of demand and supply. Movie lovers who do not want to spend on a release end up downloading a pirated copy on the Tamilrockers site. As more patrons continue to visit their site, they continue to provide movies for free downloads. This way Tamilrockers makes money while eating away a chunk of the movies' producers' earnings.<br/><br/>

Meanwhile, Ayushmann Khurrana and Nushrat Bharucha's romantic comedy film Dream Girl saw almost the double occupancy on Saturday as compared to the opening day. As per initial box office estimates, Dream Girl raked in Rs 15 crore (approximately) on Day 2. Dream Girl revolves around the life of a man who is caught up in a comedy of errors. Educated but unemployed Karamvir Singh lands a job at a 'friendship call centre' and takes on a woman's voice for his telephonic conversations. The only problem is that his male clients are besotted by the lovely voice at the other end of the line.<br/><br/>
  ->Multi starrer comedy-drama Housefull 4 has become the recent target of piracy by Tamilrockers. The fourth iteration in the Housefull franchise has reportedly been leaked online on piracy group Tamilrockers' webfront.

Akshay Kumar's Housefull 4 was the most liked by audience this Diwali weekend and led the box office collection chart at the ticket counters, despite two other releases. Housefull 4 clashed with Taapsee Pannu and Bhumi Pednekar's Saand Ki Aankh and Rajkummar Rao and Mouni Roy's Made In China.<br/><br/>

It was also Akshay's third big release of 2019 after Kesari and Mission Mangal.Directed by Farhad Samji, the film stars Akshay Kumar, Riteish Deshmukh, Kriti Sanon, Bobby Deol, Pooja Hegde, Chunky Panday and Kriti Kharbanda. Housefull 4 has registered total box office collection of Rs 50 crore (approximately) in its opening weekend, despite receiving a barrage of criticism from several film critics.

With movie now release online by the notorious website, it is yet to be seen how this affects the box office collection and dent its earnings for the makers.<br/><br/>
  ->Tamilrockers is staying in news for all the wrong reasons. While the Indian film industry is fighting hard against piracy, the notorious website is becoming infamous for leaking several South Indian, Hollywood and Bollywood films within a day of their theatrical release. Days after it had leaked Saaho full movie download link, the website has done the same with another Shradhha Kapoor release. Chhichhore full movie download link has now been leaked by Tamilrockers, a day after the Sushant Singh Rajput starrer hit the big screens. <br/><br/>

Chhichhore revolves around the lives of few college friends and has released to decent box office collections. The film is the story of few college friends - Anni (Sushant Singh Rajput), Maya (Shraddha Kapoor), Sexa (Varun Sharma), Derek (Tahir Raj Bhasin), Acid (Naveen Polishetty), Mummy (Tushar Pandey), and Bevda (Saharsh Kumar Shukla).

According to the official synopsis, the film creates "a world where one meets interesting characters, shares great times and becomes friends for life." It had earned Rs 7.32 crore on the opening day and saw a jump in its collection on day 2.  <br/><br/>
  ->Disney's live action adaptation of The Lion King is the big release this week. And it looks like the film has become the latest victim of piracy by the website TamilRockers, who have diligently leaked multiple Hollywood and Bollywood movies, week after week.

A few days after leaking Hrithik Roshan's Super 30, the website has made the full movie of The Lion King available online. The movie has already hit the internet within few hours of its release on Friday.<br/><br/>

The Jon Favreau directed film is an updated version of the 1994 animated classic of the same name. The characters and environments are recreated in high-definition 3D instead of the 2D hand-drawn style of the original. Favreau has updated the 1994 screen classic with photo-realistic, computer-generated animation, to bring back the adventures of Simba, who is to succeed his father Mufasa as King of the Pride Lands.<br/><br/>

The Lion King released in India in four languages. The original English version, which released in the US, occupies most of the screen counts. However, the movie has been dubbed in three languages in India - Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. Reports say that The Lion King's English and Hindi versions have leaked online.

The film released to 2140 screens in India today and is expected to be the big draw for audiences over the weekend. It is being speculated whether the leak could affect its box office collections.
  The film has breathtaking visuals and voice performances, but the animal characters, while looking realistic, do not emote as much as the classic animated version.<br/><br/>
  ->Tenet &#8212; Christopher Nolan's epic time-bending espionage movie &#8212; has seemingly leaked onto torrent sites and other networks that enable piracy, in multiple differing versions of quality. While some copies are arguably genuine, given the attached screenshots and user comments attesting to their legitimacy, many are fraudulent and merely exist as a trap to load viruses, malware, and whatnot onto the computers of unsuspecting individuals. But even in those genuine cases, the illegal Tenet copies are of remarkably poor quality, feature hard-coded subtitles, and/or are filled with advertisements. Gadgets 360 does not condone illegal file-sharing.<br/><br/>
  The first legitimate leaked version of Tenet showed up on torrent sites such as The Pirate Bay, Torrentz2, and 1337x over the weekend, with the labels &#8220;KOR&#8221; and &#8220;CAM&#8221;, suggesting they were filmed with a video camera in Korean cinemas. According to public comments, nearly all of them are filled with ads for a variety of online gambling and betting companies. Since then, several modified and newer versions of &#8212; labelled &#8220;V2&#8221; for version 2.0 or &#8220;NO ADS&#8221; &#8212; have been uploaded to piracy networks, to capture the heavy interest coming from those unable to catch Tenet in theatres. File sizes range from around 1-2.6GB, depending on the version you run into.<br/><br/>
Thankfully for Warner Bros. and Nolan, who champions the value of the big-screen experience, the quality of all the illegal Tenet rips is terrible. Per publicly available screenshots, Gadgets 360 can tell that they exhibit severe issues with sharpness, detail, contrast, cropping, and/or colour. We won't be posting any screenshots out of not wanting to spoil any part of the film. Gadgets 360 has not been able to verify audio quality, though user comments suggest that it's echo-y, muffled, and hard to hear. The Tenet full movie leaks only reinforce the fact that you should check out the movie when it's officially available in theatres or on home media.<br/><br/>
  Written and directed by Nolan, Tenet stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, Michael Caine, Kenneth Branagh, Clémence Poésy, Himesh Patel, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Fiona Dourif, Andrew Howard, Martin Donovan, Sean Avery, Jack Cutmore-Scott, and Denzil Smith. Tenet was made on a reported budget of $200 million (roughly Rs. 1,470 crores), making it Nolan's most expensive movie to date. Nolan produced Tenet with his wife Emma Thomas.Tenet is out now in various parts of Europe, Australia, South-East Asia, and the Middle East. It opens this week in China and the US, followed by Russia and Japan later in September. Tenet doesn't have a release date in India yet.
